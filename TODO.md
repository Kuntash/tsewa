## Invitation UX follow-ups

- [ ] Show a dedicated invalid, expired, revoked, or already-used invitation

      organization and role and require explicit acceptance before entering the
      workspace.

## Account and email follow-ups

- [ ] Connect provider-configurable transactional email for invitations, email
      verification, and password reset.

      flow after transactional email is available.
